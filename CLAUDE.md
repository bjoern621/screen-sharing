# Working in this repo

`docs/` is the source of truth for architecture, the domain model, terminology and style.
Read the relevant page before guessing.

`docs/development-principles.md` governs the shape of every change: explicit state writes and continuous reads, one render function per component, idempotent apply paths, and preconditions, postconditions and invariants asserted with `bjoernblessin.de/go-utils/util/assert`.
It outranks brevity and convenience. Read it before writing code, not after.

`docs/frontend-coding-style.md` adds the layer rules for the React frontend.
`docs/domain-model.md` covers the codec and transport tables every consumer derives from.
